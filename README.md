# Backend Wrapper

> I'm be thinking of a better name for the project sooner.

This project is works as proxy between the frontend and the backend. The main goal is to provide a way to the frontend to communicate with the backend which does not have CORS enabled.

NOTE: This project is very similar to [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)
